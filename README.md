# Quiz-Maker

## Purpose
Make multiple choice quizzes a lot quicker! This was a quick little project made in just an hour.

## How to Use
Fork the repository. Go to `src/components/App.jsx` and edit the `questions` variable. Questions are formatted like the following:


```
question: <enter question>,
choices: [<choice 1>, <choice 2>, ...],
correct: <enter correct answer>
```

Run `npm run dev` to see your quiz in action. To actually share your link, host the website on a web hosting service (such as Vercel).

## Tools
This tool is made using Next.js, React.js, and Quillforms.
